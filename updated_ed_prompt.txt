## Main Extraction Prompt

```
Analyze this ED note and extract billable CPT codes. Follow these rules precisely:

**CPT CODE RANGES**: Only extract codes 10000-69999 and 99100-99199

**LACERATION COMBINATION RULES**:
- Multiple lacerations at SAME location → Combine lengths → Single CPT code
- Different locations → Separate CPT codes
- Example: 3cm + 4cm face lacerations = 7cm face laceration (single code)

**PROCEDURE HIERARCHY** (Same Location):
- Major procedure + Minor procedure → Bill only major procedure
- Major: Complex repair, intermediate repair, surgical procedures, fracture reduction
- Minor: Simple repair, digital blocks, local anesthesia, simple splinting
- Different locations → Can bill separately
