## Main Extraction Prompt

```
Analyze this ED note and extract billable CPT codes. Follow these rules precisely:

**CPT CODE RANGES**: Only extract codes 10000-69999 and 99100-99199

**LACERATION COMBINATION RULES**:
- Multiple lacerations at SAME location → Combine lengths → Single CPT code
- Different locations → Separate CPT codes
- Example: 3cm + 4cm face lacerations = 7cm face laceration (single code)

**PROCEDURE HIERARCHY** (Same Location):
- Major procedure + Minor procedure → Bill only major procedure
- Major: Complex repair, intermediate repair, surgical procedures, fracture reduction
- Minor: Simple repair, digital blocks, local anesthesia, simple splinting
- Different locations → Can bill separately

5. Multiple joint aspirations: Bill each joint separately

**COMPLEXITY DETERMINATION**:
- Simple: Superficial, minimal debris, simple closure
- Intermediate: Requires layered closure, significant cleaning/debridement
- Complex: Extensive undermining, complicated closure, retention sutures

**OUTPUT FORMAT**:
List only the final CPT codes to bill, one per line:
- [CPT CODE] - [Brief description]

**CRITICAL RULES**:
1. Only code documented procedures
2. Combine same-location lacerations before coding
3. Apply hierarchy rules for same location
4. Validate codes are in range 10000-69999 or 99100-99199
5. Consider anatomical modifiers for bilateral procedures
6. Include add-on codes where applicable

**ED NOTE TO ANALYZE:**
[INSERT ED NOTE HERE]

**EXTRACTED CPT CODES:**
```

## Example Usage

**Input ED Note:**
```
Patient with displaced Colles fracture and multiple lacerations:
1. Closed reduction of distal radius fracture with manipulation
2. Short arm splint application
3. Forehead laceration 3cm, simple repair
4. Hand laceration 2cm, required layered closure
5. Digital block performed for hand procedure
```

**Expected Output:**
```
25605 - Closed reduction distal radius fracture with manipulation
29125 - Short arm splint application
12013 - Forehead laceration repair, simple, 3cm
12031 - Hand laceration repair, intermediate, 2cm
```

**Reasoning:**
- Fracture reduction is major procedure, splinting is separate billable service
- Digital block covered under intermediate repair at same location
- Different anatomical locations billed separately
